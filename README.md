# House Sale Price Analysis
This GitHub repository is an extensive exercise that showcases my proficiency in data analytics using **Python**. The repository focuses on a **regression** problem, where the goal is to **predict** the sale price of houses. The dataset used for this exercise is publicly available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) and contains information about house sales, including features such as the location, size, and age of the houses.

The solution starts with **exploratory data analysis** (EDA), where I gain insights into the data by generating descriptive statistics, creating informative visualizations, and identifying patterns in the data. This helps me to better understand the relationships between different variables and to identify any missing or incorrect values.

Next, the dataset is **cleaned and new features are engineered**. This usually involves removing any unnecessary variables and handling missing values. Here, the data is merely transformed into a format suitable for modeling. I also create new variables that I believe may be useful in predicting the sale price of houses.

Finally, I apply various regression techniques, such as **linear regression, ridge/lasso regression, random forest, and gradient boosted decision tree**, to the data. I evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared. I then choose the best performing model and use it to make predictions on the test data.

This repository demonstrates my skills in:
- Python programming and the use of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data analysis and modeling.
- Understanding and implementation of exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.
- Data pre-processing and feature engineering.
- Understanding and implementation of regression algorithms.
- Ability to evaluate the performance of different models and choose the best one for the problem.
