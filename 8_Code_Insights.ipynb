    "## Correlation Heat Map\n",
    "- Most high positive correlations are unsurprising\n",
    "- More interesting:\n",
    "    - Correlation of 0.49 between yr_built and floors suggests differences in houses\n",
    "    - Sqft of the house has a stronger influence on price than the number of bath- or bedrooms\n",
    "    - -0.35 correlations of yr_built and zipcode hints toward the city's growth\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scatter Plot\n",
    "- Sales seem to be subject to weekly and yearly seasonal effects\n",
    "\n",
    "## Histograms\n",
    "- Houses were surprisingly cheap when the data was collected\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bar Plot\n",
    "- Grades and Bedrooms are less skewed than expected\n",
    "\n",
    "## Line Chart\n",
    "- Newer houses are more likely to have extra bathrooms for any probability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boxplot\n",
    "- Only 5% of houses were renovated"
